- I am a software engineer and a writer interested in the interplay between thoughts and constraints, the duality of interpretations and representations, and the nature of abstractions and correspondence between them. 

- I am a long-time practitioner of Vipassana, but I am also a fallibilist with a slight objectivist bent. So I probably have a very different view of meditation than most people. We can talk about it if you want to.

- On this website I write articles about [[Computer Science::/tags/#Software]], [[Philosophy::/tags/#Philosophy]], Mathematics, and [[Generic Life Stuff::/tags/#General]]. Sometimes I also [[review::/tags/#Review]] books that I've read. You can find my programming side-projects on [[github::https://www.github.com/rgvr]]

- I have a [[youtube channel::https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCESc8TaWpQxpHEnfhQLgzPQ]] on which I stream my work log(live writing sessions, coding sessions, reading/researching sessions, etc).
  
- If you find anything interesting about who I am or what I do, please do reach out to me. ðŸ‘‡


## Reach out to me

- Shoot me a dm or just tweet ***[[@rgvrme::https://twitter.com/r]]***. I will try to reply as soon as I can. 
  
- I live in Bangalore, so If you happen to be in Bangalore by chance and want to chat, drop an ***[[email::mailto:raghu@rgvr.me]]*** and include [Coffee] in the subject line, and we can work something out.
  
- If you are not comfortable reaching out to me directly, you can also anonymously give me [[feedback::https://www.admonymous.co/rgvr]]

::rmn]]The original design[[**Original Design**<br><img src="/assets/img/firstdesign.jpg">::lsn]] of this website was a lot more ostentatious than what you see here. As I progressed through the development process of this website, the current design started emerging on its own. For reasons I don't even understand, the current design just started feeling more natural than the one I had in my mind initially. The bare and simple look-n-feel of this site, at least to me, encompasses the essence of all the things I love about the sites I frequently visit --- feed-like structure, previews, search with context, contextual backlinks, sidenotes, etc. I am hopeful that you'll love it too. :)

- **Page preview** (Move your mouse over the link): [[Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet]]
- **Transclusion**: Allows you to see a partial view of the contents of the website to the right or the left of the margin.
- **Sidenotes** (Changelog you see on the left is an example of this).
- **Wiki-style link:** Usually wikis allow you to specify links using double bracket, I added it here using liquid. Also added bad-link highlighting
   - Good link: [[Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet]]
   - Bad link: [[Title of a page that doesn't exist]]


Some Less know features:

- Go back to the blog home or to the notes page, and try to right click on any of the entry. [Hint: Zettelkasten]

- Press 'Shift + s' to trigger search

- Click this card[[Memorize me so that you do well in your exams::srs]] looking thing to know how I use my notes. [Hint: SRS]


Other Details:

- The site lives on [[Github::https://github.com/rgvr/simply-jekyll]] and is served using Netlify
- This website is statically generated using Jekyll from a set of Markdown files.
  - The Jekyll theme can be found on my Github Page, It is called "Simply-Jekyll"
- Except lunrjs and katex, there are no third party libraries. Discord is an opt-in, I don't use on my [[site::https://rgvr.me]]. I strongly believe in user privacy.
